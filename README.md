# Dimitris Lymperis â€“ Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! ðŸš€  
Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **React Router**,**Bootstrap+CSS** and hosted on **Vercel**.
I kept it simple, and minimal. Went for React router, for faster browsing through a Dropdown menu.
My very first time working with my own domain.

## Layout:
-Home Page
-About Me (Carousel Bootstrap Presentation)
-Projects (Fetching with MockAPI as a List with Projects data)
-404 error page to guide you back to Home page
-Footer with social media links at the bottom of the page, instead of Contact form
